# TokenCard ICO - Refunds Of Incorrectly Sent Payments

The TokenCard ICO commenced at May-02-2017 04:01:03 PM +UTC and closed 30 minutes 13 seconds later at May-02-2017 04:31:16 PM +UTC.

Some ethers and tokens were sent outside the crowdfunding period, and some un-approved tokens were sent during and after the crowdfunding period.

I generated a list of [results/refunds.xls](results/refunds.xls) (also available as [results/refunds.txt](results/refunds.txt)). These were compared against the refunds calculated by an independent third-party in [results/RefundCalculationsIndependentlyCalculated.csv](results/RefundCalculationsIndependentlyCalculated.csv). The reconciliation of the refund calculations can be found in [results/reconcileRefunds.xls](results/reconcileRefunds.xls).

The refunds have now been executed and the results can be seen for:
